# Computer Graphics Algorithms in Java

This repository contains simple Java implementations of foundational computer graphics algorithms, including:

- **DDA Line Drawing Algorithm**
- **Midpoint Circle Drawing Algorithm**
- **Cohen-Sutherland Line Clipping Algorithm**

Each program runs via terminal input and is organized for clarity and educational use.

## üß† Algorithms Overview

1. DDA Line Drawing
	Defination: DDA Line Drawing Algorithm that can generate return the coordinates through which a line can be drawn from one point to another.
	```Usage:
	a. Takes two endpoints.
	b. Computes intermediate points using floating-point increments.
	c. Rounds and prints the pixel locations.
	```

2. Midpoint Circle Drawing
	Defination: Mid-Point is an algorithm used to determine the points needed for rasterizing a circle. 
	```Usage:
	a. Takes radius and center as input.
	b. Uses midpoint decision parameter to draw a full circle using 8-way symmetry.
	```

3. Cohen-Sutherland Line Clipping
	Defination: The Cohen‚ÄìSutherland algorithm is a computer-graphics algorithm used for line clipping. The algorithm divides a two-dimensional space into 9 regions and then efficiently determines the lines and portions of lines that are visible in the central region 
	```Usage
	a. Takes a clipping window and a line segment.
	b. Uses region codes and logical operations to determine whether to accept, reject, or clip the line.
	```
