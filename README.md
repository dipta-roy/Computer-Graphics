# Computer-Graphics
Java based calculator for 3 algorithms ussed in computer graphics. 

This program covers following 3 alogrithm that are used in computer graphics. 
  1. DDA Line Drawing Algorithm that can generate return the coordinates through which a line can be drawn from one point to another.
  2. Mid-Point is an algorithm used to determine the points needed for rasterizing a circle. 
  3. The Cohenâ€“Sutherland algorithm is a computer-graphics algorithm used for line clipping. The algorithm divides a two-dimensional space into 9 regions and then efficiently determines the lines and portions of lines that are visible in the central region 

You would need to run Home.java which will give the suitable options. Select the options which will further ask you to provide the inputs for the program. With suitable inputs, the program is capable of sharing the answer with all the possible answers. 

The program is written in Java and can run on any version of JDK.
